Triangular numbers are those numbers that can be represented geometrically as a triangle, as shown in the image below:

The $n^{th}$ triangular number is equal to $1+2+3+...+n$.   
It can also be evaluated using the *very useful* formula $\dfrac{n(n+1)}{2}$.  

The last year that was a triangular number was 2016. What is the next year that is a triangular number?

 <blockquote> Answer: 2080</blockquote>   
  
 <p>
 The formula $\dfrac{n(n+1)}{2}$ is <em>very useful</em>.   
 By trial and error, we can find that $2016=\dfrac{63 \times 64}{2}$.
 The next triangular year is  $\dfrac{64 \times 65}{2}=2080$.
