<p>Welcome back to school !!</p>

<h1 id="problem-1">Problem 1</h1>
<p>The digital product of a number is computed by multiplying together all of its digits. For example, the digital product of $1522$ is $20$. <br />
How many $12$-digit numbers are there whose digital product is $20$?</p>

<details>
<summary>Click to show solution</summary>
$20$ can be written as the product of one-digit numbers greater than 1 in the following ways: <br />
<ul>
  <li>$4\times5$</li>
  <li>$2\times2\times5$</li>
</ul>
Our $12$-digit numbers must contain one of these plus lots of $1$s. <br />
In the first case, there are $12\times11=132$ different possible positions for the $4$ and the $5$. <br />
In the second case, there are $12\times11\times10\times\frac{1}{2}=660$ different possible positions for the $2$s and the 5$. <br />
In total, this makes $132+660=792$ numbers. <br />
<br />
</details>
<p><br /></p>

<h1 id="problem-2">Problem 2</h1>
<p>Two boxes contain between them 65 balls of several different sizes. Each ball is white, black, red or yellow. If you take any five balls of the same color, at least two of them will always be of the same size(radius). Prove that there are at least three ball which lie in the same box have the same color and have the same size(radius). <br /></p>

<details>
<summary>Click to show solution</summary>
By the pigeon hole principle (PHP) we know there are at least 17 balls of the same color among the 65 (16 * 4 + 1 = 65). WLOG, assume there are 17 red balls. Since there are 2 boxes, again by PHP we know one box must have at least 9 red balls. Among these 9, assume no three were the same color (if they were we're done). Take 5 from the 9. Then 2 of them are of the same radius, r1. Take these 2 and set them aside and then grab 2 more balls from the remaining pile of 4 to replace them. Again we have 5 balls so 2 of them must have the same radius, r2. Take these 2 and set them aside, again replacing them with 2 more from the remaining pile of 2. Having 5 balls we know 2 have the same radius, r3. Take these and set them aside and replace them with the last 2 balls. Since we have 5 we know 2 have the same radius, r4. Our 9 red balls have radii r1, r1, r2, r2, r3, r3, r4, r4, r5 where r1, r2, r3, r4, r5 are all distinct values. However r1, r2, r3, r4, r5 is a group of 5 balls which contradicts the condition that 2 of them must have the same radius. Therefore our assumption is wrong and there must be three of the same size radius.<br />

<h1 id="problem-3">Problem 3</h1>
<p>The surnames of four professional people are Bennett, Johnson, Ng 
and Wong, and their professions are accountant, lawyer, dentist and 
doctor (not necessarily in this order). The accountant and lawyer work 
in their offices, while the dentist and doctor work in their surgeries 
The accountant receives free medical treatment and looks after Ng’s 
accounts. Johnson does not know Bennett, although his surgery is in 
the same street as Bennett’s office. Johnson and the accountant settle 
their accounts by mutual negotiation. Find the occupations of the four 
people.</p>
